# simple-express-html-reload-boilerplate
This is a simple boilerplate for reloading html based on express. I'm using this for simple testing html UI.  

You need to install nodemon globally : https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon


1. Download this boilerplate and then 'npm install'.  
2. 'npm start' and then check http://localhost:3000/ open properly.  
3. Change 'public/index.html', then browser will automatically reloaded(refreshed).  
4. If you want to test another page, add it to the inside of 'public' folder, and then change get router of 'index.js'.
